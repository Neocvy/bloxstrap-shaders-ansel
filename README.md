I don't own this, copyright issues (just in case)

all credits goes to 'pizzaboxer', you can find the original at https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases
this is a fork of the original modified so that it launches 'eurotrucks2' as opposed to 'RobloxPlayerBeta' which'll trick NVIDIA ansel into thinking it's running a supported game and things of that nature
